# Additional Requirements
Functionally same with day 39, with the added requirements:
1. Allow users to subscribe using their emails. 
2. Subscribers will be sent notifications on flight deals.
3. Error handling on no search results
4. Add Google flight link to notifications sent.

# Might or might not fix:
A requirement from day 39 carried on to day 40 which I understood wrongly: \
- The from and to dates on the notification.

It's supposed to be the round trip dates, but I implemented it as the departure \
dates of the first and last flights of flights having the same price. \
