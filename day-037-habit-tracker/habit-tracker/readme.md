If starting from scratch, the order of operation:

1. **post-new-user.py** - create a new user on pixela.
2. **post-new-graph.py** - create new graph.
3. **post-new-pixels.py** - creates a new pixel for graph. Can also be used for updating existing pixel.
4. **put-update-pixel.py** - update existing pixel.
5. **delete-remove-pixel.py**  - remove existing pixel.

main.py can be ignored. It's where everything started, I don't have the heart to DELETE it ðŸ¥¹
